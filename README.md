#  API ITunes Search App

A project that uses the ITunes API to retrieve music, movies, podcasts, audiobooks and television shows based on an artist/author input. Also, the user can specify a country, to show all available results in that specific country (user's current country location is used if not selected manually).

Results will display with their titles, artist/authors and a button to 'View details'. If the button is clicked, extra information is shown, such as price, time, genre...
